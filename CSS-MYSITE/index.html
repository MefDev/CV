        <h3>My Story</h3>
        <p class="paragraph-1">
          When I was 12 years old, my dad has bought me my first pc. Back then, I knew neither programming nor English yet. <br>
          I started searching about programming lately in 2014, but I started coding on Codeacademy in 2015. <br>
          I started with C# because I was fascinated by how games work and function. I've been good at solving problems since I was in high school. <br>
          Yet making video games from scratch was really a hurdle! After I learned C# Fundamentals and started getting my hands dirty with games, <br>
          I started my web development journey in 2020, and I am cracking it till today. <br>
          I made this first personal website to show how far I had got, so here it is. By the way, I love creating things.<br>
